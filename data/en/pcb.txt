Step-by-step PCB Charger Assembly Guide Gather the necessary material for PCB Charger assembly: Charger Plate (1x); Coil 22 μF (1x); Condenser 10 μF (3x); Header Male 1 pin (4x); Resistance 100 mΩ (1x); Charger Diode (1x); Ceramic condenser 100 nF (1x); Welding Kit; Fit the 100 mΩ Resistor in the Rs position, as shown in the figure below, solder and then cut what was left in excess. Fit the 100 nF Ceramic Condenser in the Cvreg position, the 10 μF Condensers in the Cvin, Cvs and Cbat position, the Charger Diode in the D position as shown in the figure below, solder and then cut what was left in excess. Note: Pay attention to the polarity of the 10 μF Condenser and the Charger Diode that is indicated on each of the components. Fit each of the Header Male 1 pin to the ends of the PCB Charger and solder. Solder (shunt) the pads next to the SET marking. After completing the assembly process, the technician must test the conductivity of the Charger Plate with the Multimeter, to verify the existence of points that are short-circuited. After passing the conductivity test, the technician must write the initials of his name on the Charger Plate. Place the Charger Board in the corresponding stock section (Charger Board – To Test).
