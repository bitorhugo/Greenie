* Guide on how to train model
** QuickStart
*** Completions EndPoint
	Core of OpenAI API. Provides a flexible yet powerfull interface.
	Give prompt as INPUT receive text completion as OUTPUT.
	e.g
	    Prompt) Write a name for a horse
	    OUTPUT) Lighting
        
*** Adjectives
	Giving prompt simple adjectives can result in a modified text completion.
	e.g
	    Prompt) Write a name for a black horse
	    OUTPUT) Midnight

*** Examples
	In many cases, itâ€™s helpful to both show and tell the model what you want. Adding examples to your prompt can help communicate patterns.
	e.g.
	    Prompt) Suggest three names for an animal that is a superhero.
                Animal: Cat
		    	Names: Captain Sharpclaw, Agent Fluffball, The Incredible Feline
				Animal: Dog
				Names: Ruff the Protector, Wonder Canine, Sir Barks-a-Lot
				Animal: Horse
				Names:

	    OUTPUT) Super Stallion, Mighty Mare, The Magnificent Equine

*** Temperature
	Setting that provides different outputs for the same input. Gives a broader range of possible text completions.
    Accepts values between 0 and 1.
    The closer it is to 0, the fewer risks it takes.
    It is best to set temperature as low as possible for well-defined output

*** Fine Tuning
Involves 3 steps:
-> Prepare and upload Data (JSONL Document: each line is a prompt-completion pair corresponding to a training example)
a data preparation tool is available (openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f <LOCAL_FILE>)
-> Train
-> Use trained model
